# MYSQL-Project
MySQL Workbench: A robust visual tool for efficient MySQL database management. Simplifying design, development, and administration with a user-friendly interface. Features include schema modeling, SQL autocompletion, and visual query building. Essential for developers and administrators alike.


The Faasos project was successfully executed using MySQL Workbench, demonstrating a practical application of SQL skills. The project involved creating a relational database with tables for drivers, ingredients, rolls, customer orders, and driver order details. The SQL queries, crafted within MySQL Workbench, covered a range of analyses, including counting total rolls, determining unique customer orders, and assessing the success of deliveries by drivers. The queries also explored various aspects such as the types and quantities of rolls delivered, the relationship between order changes and customer satisfaction, and statistics on average distance traveled and delivery times. The project was a hands-on experience in utilizing MySQL Workbench for database querying and analysis. The comprehensive code and results are detailed in the FAASOS project text file, serving as a valuable reference for further skill development in SQL and database management using MySQL Workbench.
